# WorkoutTracker
A basic workout planner and tracker. 
BootDev "First Personal Project". 
Being built in Python for simplicity; not because it's the best choice for this kind of application.

## Roadmap
#### Primary:
- [ ] wxPython application
- [ ] User definable exercises
- [ ] User definable workout plan
- [ ] Convert plan to printable format
- [ ] Record actual workout results (i.e. exercise A, set x, y reps at z weight)
- [ ] Recall most recent actuals when planning new workout with same exercise
- [ ] 'Installer' for Windows and Linux
  - [ ] Create user data directory for storing saved objects
  - [ ] OS specific launcher (.ps1 and shortcut, .sh and symlink)
- [ ] 'Uninstaller' for Windows and Linux
  - [ ] Delete all artifacts belonging to the program

#### Stretch:
- [ ] PyInstaller build package? 
- [ ] Progression suggestions?
- [ ] 4-8 week program builder?
- [ ] Cleaner source / test layout 
  - might not be a stretch, depending on how annoyed I get at having all of my code in the same directory...
