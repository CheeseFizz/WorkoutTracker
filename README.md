# WorkoutTracker
A basic workout planner and tracker. 
BootDev "First Personal Project". 
Being built in Python for simplicity; not because it's the best choice for this kind of application.

## Roadmap
#### Primary:
- [ ] wxPython application
- [x] User definable exercises
- [x] User definable workout plan
- [x] Convert plan to printable format
  - [x] Text representation of a plan
  - [x] Save text representation to file
- [ ] Record actual workout results (i.e. exercise A, set x, y reps at z weight)
- [ ] Record best weight and rep achievements
- [ ] Recall most recent actuals when planning new workout with same exercise
- [ ] 'Installer' for Windows and Linux
  - [ ] Create user data directory for storing saved objects
  - [ ] OS specific launcher (.ps1 and shortcut, .sh and symlink)
- [ ] 'Uninstaller' for Windows and Linux
  - [ ] Delete all artifacts belonging to the program

#### Stretch:
- [ ] Prettier, printable export of workout plan
- [ ] PyInstaller build package? 
- [ ] Progression suggestions?
- [ ] 4-8 week program builder?
- [ ] Best weight/reps on particular set? (i.e. only got 7 reps on set 3 last week at x weight, but got 8 this week)
- [ ] Cleaner source / test layout 
  - might not be a stretch, depending on how annoyed I get at having all of my code in the same directory...
